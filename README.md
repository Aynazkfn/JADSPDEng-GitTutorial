# JADSPDEng-GitToturial
In this repository JADS PDEng students can experiment with the use of Git and GitHub.

## Prerequisites
1. Installed version of Git Bash
2. An account on GitHub

## Assignments: 
1. Become a contributor to an open source project by making a pull request. Check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to check how to do this! Note that your pull request will be accepted by me if your name is added to the list below.
2. Right now the project just contains a simple `.py` script that displays the names of all contributors of this project. Make a proposal for a more exciting version of this script. For instance adding statistics or visualizations about the number of persons that are within the group of contributors or references. Be creative!
