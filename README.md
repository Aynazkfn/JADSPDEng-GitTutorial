# JADSPDEng-GitTutorial
In this repository JADS PDEng students can experiment with the use of Git and GitHub.

## Prerequisites
1. Installed version of Git Bash
2. An account on GitHub

## Assignments: 
1. Become a contributor to an open source project by making a pull request. Check the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to check how to do this! Note that your pull request will be accepted by me if your name is added to the list below.
2. Using Git and GitHub is not solving all your troubles. Sometimes your pull request will generate a [Merge Conflict](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts). 
		- Make a new branch on top of your local copy's `master` branch by `git checkout -b <your-new-branch>`
		- Change the line with your name to your fancy nickname in the contributors list
		- add and commit the changes
		- run `git merge master` what will happen now? Can you solve it?
